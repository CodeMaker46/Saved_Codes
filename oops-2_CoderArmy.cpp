	// Destructor :-

	// It is an instance member function that is invoked automatically whenever an object is going to be destroyed.

	// It is a last fn that is going to be called before an object is destroyed.

		// same by default hota hai but user wala banane pe....

		// ye basically heap me dynamically allocated 
		// memory ko hatane ke liye use hota hai what is does :
		// delete value;

		cout<<"Destructor is called for acc : "<<acc<<endl;
		// aur jo object ka instance sabse last me hua hai uska pehle 
		// call hota hai destructor

		// but constructor order me hi hota hai

		// why destructor do this ? :

		// Memory Safety and Dependencies
		// If an object depends on another (e.g., B depends on A), and you destroy A first, then B may crash if it tries to access A during its destruction.

		// Using LIFO ensures:

		// Dependencies are still valid during destruction.

		// Objects clean up in the reverse order of setup, preventing resource leaks or crashes.

		// Destructors are called in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.

		// This means the last object created is destroyed first.

		// It happens because C++ uses a stack for storing local objects.

		// The stack always removes the last added item first.

		// This ensures all objects are cleaned up safely and correctly.
